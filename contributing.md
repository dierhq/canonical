## üìã Development Standards

### Code Style
- **PEP 8** compliance
- **Type hints** for all functions
- **Docstrings** for classes and functions
- **Meaningful variable names**
- **Error handling** with appropriate logging

### Testing
- **Unit tests** for core functionality
- **Integration tests** for API endpoints
- **Test coverage** should not decrease
- **Test data** should be representative

### Documentation
- **Code comments** for complex logic
- **API documentation** for new endpoints
- **README updates** for new features
- **Examples** for new functionality

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Guidelines

### Adding New SIEM Formats
1. **Create parser** in `src/canonical/parsers/`
2. **Add conversion logic** in `src/canonical/core/converter.py`
3. **Update models** in `src/canonical/core/models.py`
4. **Add tests** in `tests/`
5. **Update documentation**

### Adding New Data Sources
1. **Create ingestion script** in `src/canonical/data_ingestion/`
2. **Update configuration** in `src/canonical/core/config.py`
3. **Add CLI commands** in `src/canonical/cli.py`
4. **Add collection setup** in `src/canonical/services/chromadb.py`

### Performance Considerations
- **Memory efficiency** for large datasets
- **Async/await** for I/O operations
- **Batch processing** for bulk operations
- **Caching** for frequently accessed data
